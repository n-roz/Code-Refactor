HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

In this project, I refactored Horiseon's website code to make it more accessible using HTML5 and CSS best practices.

## Challenges

When completing this project, the main challenge I came across was selecting the correct semantic elements. For the main section, I chose the <section> element over <article>. There is much information on documentation and guidelines online, I chose the <section> element following advice I received during instruction.

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage that meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN I find that they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
